                <h2>Forest Cover Type Classification Using Deep Learning</h2>
                <p>This project aims to classify forest cover types based on cartographic variables using a deep learning approach. Using data from Colorado's Roosevelt National Forest, specifically from the U.S. Forest Service's Region 2, a neural network model was developed to predict seven forest cover types, including Spruce/Fir, Lodgepole Pine, and Ponderosa Pine, based on features like soil type, elevation, and slope.</p>

                <h2>Galaxy Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h2>
                <p>This project focuses on classifying deep space galaxies into different morphological categories using image data and deep learning techniques. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a state-of-the-art approach for image recognition, the model was designed to extract and analyze key visual features of galaxies, such as shape, structure, and brightness distribution.</p>
